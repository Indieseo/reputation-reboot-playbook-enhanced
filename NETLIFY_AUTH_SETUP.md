Custom email template: (optional)
```

### Step 3: Invite Authorized Users
1. Go to **Identity → Users**
2. Click **"Invite users"**
3. Add emails one by one (must be @indiecampers.com):
   ```
   ceo@indiecampers.com
   strategy@indiecampers.com
   marketing@indiecampers.com
   [add more as needed]
   ```

## 🔒 How It Works

### User Experience
1. **First Visit:** User sees professional login screen
2. **Click "Sign In":** Netlify Identity modal opens
3. **Enter Email:** Must be @indiecampers.com domain
4. **Email Verification:** User receives confirmation email
5. **Access Granted:** Can view presentation
6. **Remember Session:** Stays logged in across visits

### Security Features
- ✅ Domain restriction (@indiecampers.com only)
- ✅ Email verification required
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Professional error screens
- ✅ Easy sign-out functionality
- ✅ No search engine indexing

### Visual Indicators
- Green dot and email shown when authenticated

## 🛠️ Administrative Tasks

### Adding New Users
```bash
Netlify Dashboard → Identity → Users → Invite User
Email: firstname.lastname@indiecampers.com
Role: (leave default)
```

### Removing Access
```bash
Netlify Dashboard → Identity → Users → [User] → Delete
```

### View Access Logs
```bash
Netlify Dashboard → Identity → Users 
# Shows login history and user activity
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Domain Validation
- Only emails ending in `@indiecampers.com` are allowed
- Subdomains like `user@sales.indiecampers.com` will be REJECTED
- Similar domains like `indiecampers.org` will be REJECTED

### User Management
- **Invite-only system** - users cannot self-register
- **Admin must invite** each user individually
- **Users get email** with setup instructions
- **Sessions persist** until user signs out

## 📊 Current Status

**Authentication:** ✅ Fully Implemented
**Domain Restriction:** ✅ Active (@indiecampers.com only)
**UI Integration:** ✅ Professional design matching presentation
**Build Status:** ✅ Ready for deployment

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Netlify** (current build ready)
2. **Enable Identity** in Netlify dashboard
3. **Invite initial users** (CEO, strategy team)
4. **Test access** with authorized emails
5. **Test rejection** with unauthorized emails

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Identity not enabled"
**Solution:** Enable Identity in Netlify dashboard first

### Issue: "User can't sign up"
**Solution:** Registration is invite-only by design - admin must invite

### Issue: "@indiecampers.com email rejected"
**Solution:** Check exact spelling and format

### Issue: "Session expired"
**Solution:** User should sign out and sign in again
